This is an Inn reservation system created for my Intro to Databases class.
After launching the program, there are several options the user can select:
  1: Display a list of all rooms with the following info: room name, room code, number of beds, type of bed, max. occupancy, base rate, type of decor, 'Popularity Score' (number of days occupied in last 180 days/180), next possible checkin date, length of most recent stay and date of most recent stay's checkout
  2: Option to book a room based off of user input of the following: Firstname, Lastname, Check-in date, Check-out date, number of adults, number of children, OPTIONAL<Room code, type of bed>
  3: Delete a reservation matching a user-given reservation code
  4: Search for reservations in database based off the following user-given info: OPTIONAL<Firstname, Lastname, Check-in date, Check-out date, Room code, Reservation code>
  5: Return a table of revenue for each room in each calendar month, and a column for annual revenue for each year
The user can type 'exit' to exit, or ^C.
